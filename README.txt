I wrote a small program in python that converts an image into css.  It uses the scipy and time libraries.  It asks you the file name (needs to be in the same directory as the python file), the resolution you want, the border-radius, and white space between "pixels".  You can get really high resolution stuff but it crashes my web browser.
